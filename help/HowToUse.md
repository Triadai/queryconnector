> You have to ensure that the JDBC driver that you intend to use is installed and configured correctly. The .jar file of the driver must be inserted on the LibreOffice/OpenOffice classpath. Go to **Tools->Options->Advanced** then click on the
**Class Path** button. In the showed dialog, click on the **Add Archive** button and select the .jar file that contains the driver.

 5b) If you choose, instead, to use ODBC, click on the *Select ODBC source ...* button and you will see the following dialog box

that allows you to select the ODBC source from those configured at the user level, system level or through the use of *.dsn files.
